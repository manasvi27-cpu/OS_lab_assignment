--- First Fit Memory Allocation ---
Enter partition sizes (space-separated): 300 500 450 600
Enter process sizes (space-separated): 212 417 112 426 
Process 1 allocated in Partition 1
Process 2 allocated in Partition 2
Process 3 allocated in Partition 3
Process 4 allocated in Partition 4

--- Best Fit Memory Allocation ---
Enter partition sizes (space-separated): 300 500 450 600
Enter process sizes (space-separated): 212 417 112 426
Process 1 allocated in Partition 1
Process 2 allocated in Partition 3
Process 3 allocated in Partition 2
Process 4 allocated in Partition 4

--- Worst Fit Memory Allocation ---
Enter partition sizes (space-separated): 300 500 450 600
Enter process sizes (space-separated): 212 417 112 426
Process 1 allocated in Partition 4
Process 2 allocated in Partition 2
Process 3 allocated in Partition 3
Process 4 cannot be allocated
